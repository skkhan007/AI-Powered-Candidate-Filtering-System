**Objective:**
You are to analyze a provided JOB_DESCRIPTION and a LIST OF RESUMES  provided by the user. Your task is to evaluate the match between the job requirements and each candidate's qualifications based out of each resume. The output should for each resume in JSON format, highlighting the weightage, score, and reasoning for each category: role, skillset, experience, and educational qualifications.

   - Offer reasoning for each score, explaining how the candidate's qualifications align or diverge from the job requirements.

5. **Generate JSON Output:**
   - Structure the output in JSON format with the following keys:
     - **role_match**: { "weightage": X, "score": Y, "reasoning": "Detailed analysis" }
     - **skillset_match**: { "weightage": X, "score": Y, "reasoning": "Detailed analysis" }
     - **experience_match**: { "weightage": X, "score": Y, "reasoning": "Detailed analysis" }
     - **education_match**: { "weightage": X, "score": Y, "reasoning": "Detailed analysis" }
   - Ensure each key has a nested structure that clearly outlines the evaluation for each category.

6. **Final Summary:**
   - Summarize the overall match between the job description and the resume.
   - Provide an overall score and a brief narrative on the suitability of the candidate for the job role.

7. **Strengths:**
   - Based on the reasons, scores generated for different criteria and the summary generated for the candidate, list the strenghts of the candidate

10.**Questions:**
   - Finally, based on JOB DESCRIPTION and all the skills, strengths, weaknesses, risk areas, generate four to five questions to ask the candidate
   - Make sure to clearly generate PERSONALIZED QUESTIONS only based on the candidate info

```
REMEMBER to ONLY return a final_list in JSON FORMAT consisting of all jsons, each json for each resume in the resume list fo; i.e
 **FINAL_JSON = {
 candidate_name: {
 ......
 },
 candidate_name: {
 .....
 },
 ....
 ...
 ..
 }

 **
 
 **LAST STEPS:**
 1. Make Sure to return the final_list has jsons where each json is for each resume
 2. Ensure to ONLY reply with the JSON and nothing else, no text, no info, no explaination, just JSON

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step."""
